# The Role of MCM7 and Its Hosted miR-106b-25 Cluster in Renal Cancer Progression
## Katarzyna M Głuchowska, Bartłomiej Hofman


### Abstract

Renal cancer is among the deadliest human malignancies. MCM7 is a cell cycle-
regulating gene frequently overexpressed in human cancers and associated with
hyperproliferation and cancer progression. miR-25-3p, miR-93-5p, and miR-106b-5p
form the miR-106b-25 cluster, located within the MCM7 gene. This study aims to
determine whether overexpressed miRNAs in ccRCC regulate common target genes
and enhance one another’s effect. We also examine whether MCM7 and miR-106b-25
cluster act synergistically to promote tumor progression. Material isolated from ccRCC
and control tissues was analysed to assess the expression of MCM7 and genes targeted
by miR-106b-25 cluster. Functional studies using RCC-derived cell lines were conducted
to evaluate the effects of miRNA overexpression on target gene expression, as well as
the contributions of MCM7 and miR-106b-25 cluster to renal cancer progression. We
demonstrate that MCM7 is upregulated at both transcript and protein levels in RCC,
contributing to cancer progression by regulating cell proliferation and modulating
caspase 3/7 activity. Additionally, we confirm that the miRNAs from miR-106b-25 cluster
regulate the expression of cancer-related genes and may contribute to their
dysregulated levels in RCC. These findings indicate that both MCM7 and the entire miR-
106b-25 cluster are involved in renal cancer progression.

### Repository overview

This repository contains the code and data used in the bioinformatics analysis performed for the associated publication. Specifically, it includes scripts and processed datasets for the analysis of TCGA-KIRC and CPTAC Pan-ccRCC cohorts. The provided workflows reproduce the computational steps that led to the generation of Figures 2 and 5 in the manuscript.  

All scripts are organized to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the results, from data preprocessing and normalization, through statistical testing, to figure generation.
